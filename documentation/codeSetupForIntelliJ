//Code setup for DBMS project

Install Sourcetree / Github / Git Bash for code management.
Download and Install Java v1.8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Why 1.8 ? Because we will be using 1.8 feature like lambda expression, etc which are not supported by lower Java versions.
Clone the repository.
Download IntelliJ (https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIU-2017.2.3.exe)-> Install -> Run -> "Do not import settings" -> Accept -> Evaluate for Free -> Accept -> "Skip All ..." -> 
Go to File->Open Project-><RepoName> folder from Cloned/ Downloaded code  and Select.
Create New Folder named "out" in <RepoName>/ path where your src folder is present. It will contain all production byte codes.
Project SDK, Modules and Library Setup: 
Go to File -> "Project Structure", then for 
Project SDK: "Project" -> "New..." -> "JDK" -> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131 (Now your 1.8 version is selected for this project). Below that, Choose Project language level as "SDK default (8 - Lambdaa, etc)". Below that, Choose Project compiler output as "out" folder created at step 9.
Modules: Under "Sources" tab, right click on "src" -> "Test Resources". (Right hand side you could see src choosen as Test Resource folder).
Press OK.
On Top Right, Click on dropdown (just before Run {play} button) and select Edit Confirguration. 
Click "+" -> "Application" -> Give Name, Select Main class (main class is saved by name main.java, it would automatically search) under Project tab. Press OK.
